# Planum
FilePathTools is a module that allows you to input a file path and move up n-levels towards the root directory. In addition, you have the option of appending a string to the output if you need to access subfolders originating a level above from the current file's location in a directory. 

For example:

This was created because there wasn't a way to describe where dependent python files were in a folder that was shared by several tools. This makes sense if you are form the architecture/design technology world and have worked with PyRevit. At any rate, others may find this tool useful so it has been made available to anyone. Please comment and share, and email me with any recommendations about features that you would like, or bugs that need to be addressed.

## Getting Started

The preferred method of installation is to use pip install FilePathTools. Conversely, you may also fork this repo and reference the FilePathTools.py file directly in your code.

### Prerequisites

There are no 3rd party or external modules that need to be downloaded to get this tool to work. All the modules used in this tool are part of the standard libraries for Python 2, Python 3, and IronPython.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why
